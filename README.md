# Bookstore-C-App
This project was developed during my university's course "SOFTWARE ENGINEERING"<br>
Language: C#<br>
<br>

This program is a C# bookstore app that runs locally. 

It allows users to:
- search books
- purchase books
- evaluate the books
- make comments about the books/ ask questions about them towards the authors

The author of a book can:
- search books
- view their sales and statistics
- respond to comments and questions
- View book critiques
